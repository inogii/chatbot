# RAG Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot that uses the RAG model to answer questions. The RAG model is a retrieval-augmented generation model that uses a retriever to find relevant documents and a generator to generate answers. This chatbot uses the `transformers` library to load a pre-trained RAG model and interact with it.
